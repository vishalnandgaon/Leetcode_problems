[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-seconds-to-make-mountain-height-zero/)

---

You are given an integer `mountainHeight` denoting the height of a mountain.

You are also given an integer array `workerTimes` representing the work time of workers in **seconds**.

Each worker may reduce the mountain's height by any **non-negative integer** amount. If worker `i` reduces the height by `x`, then:

- reducing the first unit of height takes `workerTimes[i]` seconds,
- reducing the second unit takes `workerTimes[i] * 2` seconds,
- ...
- reducing the `x`-th unit takes `workerTimes[i] * x` seconds.

The total time spent by worker `i` is the sum of the times required for all `x` units they reduce. As all workers operate simultaneously, the total time required is the **maximum** time spent by any worker.

Return an integer representing the **minimum** number of seconds required for the workers to make the height of the mountain 0.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** mountainHeight = 4, workerTimes = [2,1,1]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

One way the height of the mountain can be reduced to 0 is:

- Worker 0 reduces the height by 1, taking `workerTimes[0] = 2` seconds.
- Worker 1 reduces the height by 2, taking `workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 = 3` seconds.
- Worker 2 reduces the height by 1, taking `workerTimes[2] = 1` second.

Since they work simultaneously, the minimum time needed is `max(2, 3, 1) = 3` seconds.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** mountainHeight = 10, workerTimes = [3,2,2,4]

**Output:** 12

**Explanation:**

- Worker 0 reduces the height by 2, taking `workerTimes[0] + workerTimes[0] * 2 = 9` seconds.
- Worker 1 reduces the height by 3, taking `workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 + workerTimes[1] * 3 = 12` seconds.
- Worker 2 reduces the height by 3, taking `workerTimes[2] + workerTimes[2] * 2 + workerTimes[2] * 3 = 12` seconds.
- Worker 3 reduces the height by 2, taking `workerTimes[3] + workerTimes[3] * 2 = 12` seconds.

The number of seconds needed is `max(9, 12, 12, 12) = 12` seconds.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** mountainHeight = 5, workerTimes = [1]

**Output:** 15

**Explanation:**

There is only one worker in this example, so the answer is `workerTimes[0] + workerTimes[0] * 2 + workerTimes[0] * 3 + workerTimes[0] * 4 + workerTimes[0] * 5 = 15`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= mountainHeight <= 10^5`
- `1 <= workerTimes.length <= 10^4`
- `1 <= workerTimes[i] <= 10^6`
