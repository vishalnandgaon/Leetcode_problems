**Difficulty:** Medium  
[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-path-with-edge-reversals/)

---

You are given a directed, weighted graph with `n` nodes labeled from 0 to `n - 1`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, w_i]` represents a directed edge from node `u_i` to node `v_i` with cost `w_i`.

Each node `u_i` has a switch that can be used **at most once**: when you arrive at `u_i` and have not yet used its switch, you may activate it on one of its incoming edges `v_i &rarr; u_i` reverse that edge to `u_i &rarr; v_i` and **immediately** traverse it.

The reversal is only valid for that single move, and using a reversed edge costs `2 * w_i`.

Return the **minimum** total cost to travel from node 0 to node `n - 1`. If it is not possible, return -1.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[0,1,3],[3,1,1],[2,3,4],[0,2,2]]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

- Use the path `0 &rarr; 1` (cost 3).
- At node 1 reverse the original edge `3 &rarr; 1` into `1 &rarr; 3` and traverse it at cost `2 * 1 = 2`.
- Total cost is `3 + 2 = 5`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[0,2,1],[2,1,1],[1,3,1],[2,3,3]]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

- No reversal is needed. Take the path `0 &rarr; 2` (cost 1), then `2 &rarr; 1` (cost 1), then `1 &rarr; 3` (cost 1).
- Total cost is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
- `1 <= edges.length <= 10^5`
- `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, w_i]`
- `0 <= u_i, v_i <= n - 1`
- `1 <= w_i <= 1000`
