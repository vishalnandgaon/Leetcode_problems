# 3623. Count Number of Trapezoids I

**Difficulty:** Medium  
[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-trapezoids-i/)

---

You are given a 2D integer array `points`, where `points[i] = [x_i, y_i]` represents the coordinates of the `i^th` point on the Cartesian plane.

A **horizontal** **trapezoid** is a convex quadrilateral with **at least one pair** of horizontal sides (i.e. parallel to the x-axis). Two lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope.

Return the  *number of unique* ***horizontal* *trapezoids*** that can be formed by choosing any four distinct points from `points`.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** points = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,0],[2,2],[3,2]]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

There are three distinct ways to pick four points that form a horizontal trapezoid:

- Using points `[1,0]`, `[2,0]`, `[3,2]`, and `[2,2]`.
- Using points `[2,0]`, `[3,0]`, `[3,2]`, and `[2,2]`.
- Using points `[1,0]`, `[3,0]`, `[3,2]`, and `[2,2]`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** points = [[0,0],[1,0],[0,1],[2,1]]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

There is only one horizontal trapezoid that can be formed.

**Constraints:**

- `4 <= points.length <= 10^5`
- `&ndash;10^8 <= x_i, y_i <= 10^8`
- All points are pairwise distinct.
