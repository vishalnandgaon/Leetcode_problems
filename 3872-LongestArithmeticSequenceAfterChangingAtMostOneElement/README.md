[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-arithmetic-sequence-after-changing-at-most-one-element/)

---

You are given an integer array `nums`.

A subarray is **arithmetic** if the difference between consecutive elements in the subarray is constant.

You can replace **at most one** element in `nums` with any **integer**. Then, you select an arithmetic subarray from `nums`.

Return an integer denoting the **maximum** length of the arithmetic subarray you can select.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [9,7,5,10,1]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

- Replace `nums[3] = 10` with 3. The array becomes `[9, 7, 5, 3, 1]`.
- Select the subarray `[**9, 7, 5, 3, 1**]`, which is arithmetic because consecutive elements have a common difference of -2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,6,7]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

- Replace `nums[0] = 1` with -2. The array becomes `[-2, 2, 6, 7]`.
- Select the subarray `[**-2, 2, 6**, 7]`, which is arithmetic because consecutive elements have a common difference of 4.

**Constraints:**

- `4 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
