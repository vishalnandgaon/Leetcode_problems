# 3464. Maximize the Distance Between Points on a Square

**Difficulty:** Hard  
[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-the-distance-between-points-on-a-square/)

---

You are given an integer `side`, representing the edge length of a square with corners at `(0, 0)`, `(0, side)`, `(side, 0)`, and `(side, side)` on a Cartesian plane.

You are also given a **positive** integer `k` and a 2D integer array `points`, where `points[i] = [x_i, y_i]` represents the coordinate of a point lying on the **boundary** of the square.

You need to select `k` elements among `points` such that the **minimum** Manhattan distance between any two points is **maximized**.

Return the **maximum** possible **minimum** Manhattan distance between the selected `k` points.

The Manhattan Distance between two cells `(x_i, y_i)` and `(x_j, y_j)` is `|x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j|`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** side = 2, points = [[0,2],[2,0],[2,2],[0,0]], k = 4

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

Select all four points.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** side = 2, points = [[0,0],[1,2],[2,0],[2,2],[2,1]], k = 4

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

Select the points `(0, 0)`, `(2, 0)`, `(2, 2)`, and `(2, 1)`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** side = 2, points = [[0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[2,0],[2,2],[2,1]], k = 5

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/01/28/4080_example2_revised.png)

Select the points `(0, 0)`, `(0, 1)`, `(0, 2)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 2)`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= side <= 10^9`
- `4 <= points.length <= min(4 * side, 15 * 10^3)`
- `points[i] == [x_i, y_i]`
- The input is generated such that:

- `points[i]` lies on the boundary of the square. - All `points[i]` are **unique**.

- `4 <= k <= min(25, points.length)`
